# Text-to-Video Generation using GANs

## Overview
This project aims to generate realistic video sequences from textual descriptions using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The system takes as input natural language descriptions and produces corresponding video sequences that visually represent the content described in the text. The goal is to create a seamless mapping between text and video, enabling the generation of dynamic visual narratives from textual input.
