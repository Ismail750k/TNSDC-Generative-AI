# Text-to-Video Generation using GANs

## Overview
This project aims to generate realistic video sequences from textual descriptions using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The system takes as input natural language descriptions and produces corresponding video sequences that visually represent the content described in the text. The goal is to create a seamless mapping between text and video, enabling the generation of dynamic visual narratives from textual input.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- tqdm (for progress bars)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/Ismail750k/TNSDC-Generative-AI.git
2. Install dependencies:pip install -r "requirements"

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset: Organize your text and corresponding video data in a suitable format. Each text should be paired with its corresponding video sequence.

2. Preprocess the data: Preprocess the text and video data as needed. Tokenize the text, extract visual features from video frames, and prepare the data for training.

3. Train the model: Train the GAN-based model on your preprocessed dataset. Adjust hyperparameters, architecture, and training settings as necessary to optimize performance.

4. Generate videos from text: Use the trained model to generate videos from textual descriptions. Input the desired text prompts and observe the corresponding generated video sequences.

5. Evaluate the results: Evaluate the quality and realism of the generated videos using quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Iterate on the model and training process as needed to improve performance.
